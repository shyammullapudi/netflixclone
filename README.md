# Netflix-Style Homepage

This project replicates a Netflix-style homepage that dynamically fetches and displays movie data using the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. The homepage includes a navbar, a featured movie banner, and several rows of movies categorized by genre.

## Features

- **Dynamic Banner**: The banner section displays a random Netflix Original show or movie as the featured content.
- **Movie Categories**: Rows of movies are displayed according to genres like Action, Comedy, Horror, Romance, and Documentaries.
- **Hover Effects**: Movie posters have a smooth hover effect that slightly enlarges the image to enhance the user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The page layout is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the page with a Netflix-inspired theme.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Handles the logic to fetch data from the TMDB API and dynamically update the DOM.
- **TMDB API**: Fetches real-time data for trending movies and TV shows.
